== A trivial example Rails app with Cucumber + Selenium testing set up and ready to go

It was generated by created a blank Rails 2.3.4 app (The first commit), running 
<tt>ruby script/generate rspec</tt> and <tt>ruby script/generate cucumber --rspec</tt> 
(the second commit).

On top of that, the modifications needed to make Selenium run were made, the third commit.

The snow_leopard branch contains the tweaks needed to run Selenium with Firefox on Snow Leopard.

Look out for:

* The addition of <tt>cucumber.yml</tt>
* The rewritten <tt>lib/tasks/cucumber.rake</tt>
* The rewritten <tt>features/support/env.rb</tt>
* The trivial Feature in <tt>features/support/env.rb</tt>
* The inclusion of the selenium-client gem in <tt>config/environments/cucumber.rb</tt>
