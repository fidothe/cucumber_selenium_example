Mixed Selenium / non-Selenium Cucumber testing
----------------------------------------------

A trivial example Rails app with Cucumber + Selenium testing set up and ready to go for Selenium and non-Selenium Scenarios within the same Feature file, using tags

It was generated by created a blank Rails 2.3.4 app (The first commit, at <http://github.com/fidothe/cucumber_selenium_example/commit/6a8693efe5767436a951fa7f27ac5e826e96cccc>), running 
`ruby script/generate rspec` and `ruby script/generate cucumber --rspec` 
(the second commit, at <http://github.com/fidothe/cucumber_selenium_example/commit/ad4deeb59595d7a15863ff8fea4d3b6801d5a383>).

After that, the modifications needed to make Selenium run were made, in the rest of the commits (<http://github.com/fidothe/cucumber_selenium_example/>).

The [snow_leopard branch](http://github.com/fidothe/cucumber_selenium_example/tree/snow_leopard) contains the tweaks needed to run Selenium with Firefox on Snow Leopard,.

Look out for:

* The addition of `cucumber.yml`
* The rewritten `lib/tasks/cucumber.rake`
* The rewritten `features/support/env.rb`
* The trivial Feature in `features/support/env.rb`
* The inclusion of the selenium-client gem in `config/environments/cucumber.rb`
